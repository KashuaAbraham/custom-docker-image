A simple docker for beginers, creating a custom docker image 
## README for Custom Docker Image

This README provides information about using a custom Docker image I created.

**Image Name:** custom-docker-image

**Description:** runs a simple python "hello" app

**Prerequisites:**

* Docker installed and running on your system. You can check the installation by running `docker version` in your terminal. Refer to the official Docker documentation for installation instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

**Building the Image (Optional):**

If you have the Dockerfile for this image, you can build it yourself using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker build -t custom-docker-image .
```

Replace `<custom-docker-image>` with the desired name for your image.

**Running the Image:**

1. **Pulling the Pre-built Image (Recommended):**

   It's recommended to pull a pre-built version of the image if it's available on a public registry like Docker Hub. You can pull the image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull <custom-docker-image>:<tag>
   ```

   Replace `<custom-docker-image>` with the name of your image on the registry (e.g., yourusername/custom-image) and `<tag>` with the specific tag you used during the build process (e.g., the `latest` tag).

2. **Running the Container:**

   Once you have the image (built or pulled), you can run a container based on it using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d <image_name>:<tag>
   ```

   This command will run the container in detached mode (`-d`), allowing it to run in the background. Replace `<custom-docker-image>` and `<tag>` with the appropriate values as mentioned earlier.
